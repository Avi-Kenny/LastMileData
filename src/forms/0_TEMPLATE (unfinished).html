        STEPS FOR CREATING A NEW FORM:
        
             1) Create a new form, starting with this as a template; delete this comment section.
                    - Naming convention is "pre_frm09_myform.html":
                        - The "pre" prefix is the category (options: fhw, fac, moh, prg, util).
                        - In "frm09", "frm" is the unique three-letter form code; "09" is the form version number.
                        - "myform" is a descriptive name for the form.
             2) Update the <title> element.
             3) Update the <span> element within the "FORM HEADER" section.
             4) Create the form body
                    - <input> elements should have class="stored" if they are to be stored in MySQL
                    - "id" attribute of the field should match the MySQL field name
             5) Update the three-letter form code in the "M&E Box"
             6) Update the value of the hidden <input> element with id="table"
                    - identical to the name of the corresponding MySQL table
                    - should be all lowercase
             7) Add a link to the form in page_deqa, within the "DE_forms" <div> element
             8) Add a link to the form in page_deqa, within the "QA_forms" <div> element
             9) Add a click handler within deqa.js (under the "(2) QA Buttons" heading)
            10) Create the MySQL table
            11) Add a link to the application cache manifest ("lastmiledata.appcache")
