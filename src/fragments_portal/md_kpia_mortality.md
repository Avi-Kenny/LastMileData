KPI Assessment (Konobo, Aug 2014) - Mortality
=============================================
*********************************************

Highlights
----------

- The neonatal mortality rate in Konobo was assessed at `28.8` per 1,000 live births, a similar rate to the national 
average of `26`, as measured by the 2013 Liberia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).
- The infant mortality rate (`48.2`) and child mortality rate (`28.0`) appear to be lower than those in the rest of the 
country.

children surviving to the first birthday. For all rates, a 5-year recall period is used.
