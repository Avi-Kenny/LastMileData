KPI Assessment (Konobo, Aug 2014) - Antenatal care
==================================================
**************************************************

Highlights
----------

- Out of women who completed a pregnancy in 2014, `94.9%` reported having received at least one ANC visit, while 
`60.1%` received at least four ANC visits (the WHO recommendation).
- ANC visitation rates appear to have generally increased since 2010, but the bulk of improvements appear to have 
predated LMH ANC programming; it is unclear whether trends reflect recall bias, historical trends, or program effects.

Antenatal care, historical
--------------------------

Note: methods used to assess historical ANC rates are succeptible to recall bias and social desirability bias.
