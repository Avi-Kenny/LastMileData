### Ebola Response

- Working with the Rivercess and Grand Gedeh County Health Teams, Last Mile Health executed a coordinated Ebola 
response effort and laid the foundations for rebuilding a resilient health system covering all six health districts 
of Rivercess County and three in Grand Gedeh, with a total population reached of roughly 93,000 people. LMH trained a 
total of 1,307 health workers and community members across the two counties to respond to the outbreak, including 267 
CHWs and 340 health facility staff. Trainings enabled participants to recognize the danger signs and symptoms of Ebola, 
communicate Ebola awareness and prevention messages to community members, and mobilize the community to isolate and 
refer suspected cases, should they emerge. In total, Last Mile Health CHWs screened over 11,000 community members for 
Ebola and provided nearly 13,000 education and awareness talks in remote communities.

- LMH medical teams visited all 33 health facilities in Grand Gedeh and Rivercess Counties, training staff in effective 
infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. Through the establishment of a MESH (Monitoring & Enhanced 
Supervision of Health facilities) program, LMH followed up monthly with facilities to troubleshoot problems and 
ensure that standards are being maintained. LMH-developed IPC measures for health facilities were shared and used by 
organizations across the country. Additionally, LMH partnered with Direct Relief to distribute a remarkable 22 tons of 
IPC supplies to the facilities to ensure that they were properly equipped.

### RM&E Team Accomplishments

- The RM&E team recently published a paper in the Journal of Global Health, titled *Remoteness and maternal and child 
health service utilization in rural Liberia: A population-based survey*. John Kraemer, RM&E Senior Technical Advisor 
and contributing author, described how "it's no surprise that those who live in rural areas are less likely to seek 
essential care from a health care facility, but for those at the farthest distances the disparity in maternal and 
child services is staggering...our study illuminates new opportunities for the health system to close this gap."
- The team released findings of an mHealth feasibility study that piloted offline data collection using mobile 
devices. The system involves CHWs using digitized reporting forms, with the information transferred via Bluetooth to 
their supervisor's device, then onto the central database. The study concluded that the system can be quickly adopted 
by CHWs, ensures accuracy of diagnoses, improves data quality, and can work reliably in challenging conditions in 
Liberia's remote communities, which lack both electricity and cell coverage.

### Remoteness

- Gboe-Ploe is one of the most remote areas in all of Liberia. The dense jungle and sprawling creeks and rivers leave 
all but one community entirely inaccessible by vehicles and motorbikes; inhabitants of some villages have to walk 
nearly 24 hours before reaching the closest health faciliy. There is no cell service, no electricity, no safe water or 
latrines, and no external organizations working in the region.
