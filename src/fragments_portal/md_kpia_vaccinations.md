KPI Assessment (Konobo, Aug 2014) - Vaccination
===============================================
***********************************************

Highlights
----------

- Out of all children 9-23 months whose mothers had their vaccine cards, only `24.1%` were fully vaccinated, less than 
half of the DHS rural average of `49.4%`.
- Out of all children 0-9 months with vaccine cards, `39.7%` were on track for full vaccination.
- Actual rates may be lower, given that children with vaccine cards are likely to have received more vaccinations than 
those without cards, and that `46.6%` of children did not have vaccine cards.
