Last Mile Survey: Konobo Baseline (2012)
========================================
****************************************

**Note:** for more information, see the full report in the "M&E Documents" section of Last Mile Data.

Purpose of survey
-----------------

The purpose of the Konobo baseline survey was to assess barriers to utilization of existing healthcare services, and to 
collect data on baseline levels of various indicators of maternal health, child health, and family planning in the 
Konobo district (which includes both the Konobo and Glio-Twarbo administrative districts). The results of the survey, 
contained within this report, will help to guide Tiyatien Health in planning the most effective and appropriate 
interventions at the clinic level and at the community level in order to improve health outcomes, particularly among 
women and children. Additionally, the baseline indicators will provide a foundation for assessing and demonstrating the 
impact of Tiyatien's health interventions.

Summary of key findings
-----------------------

### Distance to clinic

Among all respondents, the mean distance to the Konobo Health Center (KHC), measured along motor roads by GPS, was 
`28.7` kilometers. The range of walking distances was `3.5 km - 50.2 km`. The majority of respondents (`70.2%`) lived 
between `20 - 40` kilometers from KHC.

### Education

`30.0%` of women in Konobo have never attended school, and `49.0%` have only attended (but did not necessarily complete) 
primary school. Lack of schooling is a major problem along the Druwar and Flah axes in particular, where `67.5%` and 
`52.6%` of women, respectively, have never attended any school.

### Household deaths

The mean household size was `5.9` people per household, including children. Rates of household death were extremely high 
for all age groups. In the past year, `19.9%` of households had at least one death, `4.9%` of households had at least 
one under-five child death, and `2.2%` of households had at least one under-one infant death. The mean age at death was 
just `28.6` years. If infants are excluded, the mean is `32.3` years, and if all under-5 children are excluded, the 
mean is `37.9` years.

### WASH

`78.5%` of households in Konobo reported access to a hand pump for drinking water, although roughly `9%` of these 
households also used creek water at times. Additionally, given that `13.8%` of the households who had access to a pump 
reported treating their water in some way (across all geographic axes except Flah), it is likely that many of the hand 
pumps in Konobo are not being treated.

`36.5%` of households have access to an "improved, not shared" latrine (an unshared pit latrine with a slab). An 
additional `7.3%` have access to a shared pit latrine with a slab. The majority of the Konobo population (`60.9%`) 
reported using the "bush or field" for a toilet (either instead of a latrine or in addition to a latrine).

### Mosquito nets

`52%` of respondents reported having at least one mosquito net in their household. Along the Billibo and CVI axes, net 
possession was particularly low (`28.5%` and `41.1%`, respectively), and many people reported that nets were not 
available in their town or village (`65.3%` and `54.2%`, respectively). This information will hopefully allow Tiyatien 
to target net distribution outreach activities to these two axes.

### HIV testing

`43.1%` of respondents reported having been tested for HIV before. Although insufficient, this is encouraging, given 
that the national female testing rate in 2007 was `4.0%`. HIV testing was particularly low along the Flah (`17.0%`), 
Druwar (`21.9%`), Tempo (`24.6%`), and Billibo (`30.4%`) axes.

### Health system access

In the entire sample, `37.9%` of respondents said that they had been to the Konobo Health Center (KHC) at least once 
before. However, during the implementation of the survey, we learned that many people in the Konobo district were 
utilizing health facilities other than the Konobo Health Center (KHC), including the Putu Pennoken clinic in the Putu 
region and the Martha Tubman Memorial Hospital (MTMH) in Zwedru. The three axes with the highest rates of past KHC 
attendance were Flah (`87.2%`), Druwar (`84.4%`), and Banglor (`81.7%`), and the axis with the lowest rate was CVI 
(`13.3%`).

The majority of respondents (`71.6%`) said that there was something stopping them from going to KHC. By far, the two 
most common reasons for not going to clinic were "clinic is too far away" (`58.7%`) and "no transport money" (`54.3%`). 
An additional `9.4%` cited "no medicine at clinic" as a reason for not going to KHC. Broken down by axis, `34.6%` of 
respondents in Flah and `32.8%` of respondents in Billibo had the concern that there was "no medicine at clinic", 
whereas this percentage in all other axes was `15%` or less. Consequently, Tiyatien should make efforts to target the 
Billibo and Flah axes with an awareness campaign to inform communities of new interventions at KHC and to dispel any 
myths that drugs are not available.

Among all respondents, `33.7%` had taken a paid motorcycle to KHC at least once before, and `28.8%` had walked to KHC 
at least once before. Out of those who had been to KHC, `62.1%` reported sometimes walking and sometimes taking a paid 
moto, `22.8%` only took paid motos, and `12.2%` only walked. Among respondents who reported taking paid transport to 
the clinic, the mean one-way cost to reach the clinic was `$7.87` USD. Among respondents who walked to the clinic, the 
average reported walking time to the clinic was `4.7` hours.

### Pregnancy history

Our sample was slightly biased towards reproductively-active women (as noted in Section III.5 - "Reproductive History"), 
since enumerators asked to speak with "the woman in the household who had most recently completed a pregnancy". In 
Konobo, the average reproductively-active woman has had `6.3` pregnancies in her lifetime. `56.8%` have had at least 
one miscarriage, and `8.3%` have had at least one stillbirth. `72.6%` give birth by the age of 18, and the median age 
at first birth is roughly `16.5`.

The mean number of children ever born among reproductively-active women is `4.8`, and the mean number of living 
children is `3.8`. Stunningly, `46.4%` of reproductively-active women have had an under-five child (including under-one 
infants) die at some point in their lifetime, and `30.1%` of women have had an under-one infant die, regardless of age. 
By the time a woman reaches the age of 35, the probability that she will have had an under-five child die is greater 
than `50%`.

### Family Planning

Overall, just `38.4%` of reproductively-active women in Konobo said that they want more children now (regardless of 
age), which suggests that there is a strong demand for family planning methods. Basic knowledge (i.e. "has heard of it") 
of the three most commonly used birth control methods in Liberia - the "pill", the "injection", and the "male condom" - 
was nearly universal among respondents.

Out of all respondents, `55.6%` reported that they had tried at least one method before. Specifically, `27.4%` have 
tried the "male condom", `26.0%` have tried the injection, `23.4%` have tried the "pill", `1.4%` have tried the "female 
condom", and `1.1%` have tried the IUD. Experience with family planning methods was particularly low along the Druwar 
(`17.4%`) and Flah (`20.4%`) axes. This information will hopefully allow Tiyatien to target family planning outreach 
activities to these two axes.

The three most common reasons for not trying any family planning method before were "fear of side effects" (`35.8%`), 
"wants more children now" (`32.4%`), and "knows no method" (`25.9%`).

### ANC Visitation

`76.3%` of women reported visiting the ANC at least once during their last pregnancy, and `43.7%` reported visiting at 
least four times. Respondents along the Banglor, Druwar, and Flah axes went mainly to KHC, while respondents along 
other axes often went to other clinics. The most common reasons for not visiting the ANC were "clinic is too far" 
(`56.8%`), "no transportation" (`48.7%`), "costs too much money" (`28.6%`). Full ANC visitation (i.e. 4 visits or more) 
was particularly low along the Tempo (`18.5%`) and Billibo (`28.8%`) axes.

In terms of components of antenatal care, `80.6%` reported taking an iron supplement during their last pregnancy, 
`53.5%` took worm medicine, `75.8%` received a blood test, and `75.0%` received malaria prophylaxis.

### Institutional delivery

`55.3%` of respondents reported that their last delivery was in a health facility, and `55.1%` were delivered by a 
"skilled provider". Among those who did not deliver in a clinic, the most common reasons for delivering in one's own 
village were "clinic is too far" (`70.0%`), "no transportation" (`62.3%`), and "costs too much money" (`12.5%`). 
Institutional delivery was very low along the Flah (`18.5%`), Tempo (`33.1%`), and Banglor (`37.0%`) axes.

### Postnatal care

`26.0%` of respondents received a postnatal care (PNC) visit within one day of delivery, and `45.1%` received a PNC 
visit within one week. Given that most neonatal deaths occur within the first few days after birth, postnatal care 
remains an issue of great concern.

### Worm medicine for children

`63.4%` of children have ever taken worm medicine. Out of those who had taken worm medicine, the mean amount of time 
since the child had taken worm medicine was `6.7` months. Use of worm medicine was particularly low along the Billibo 
axis (`42.3%`).

### Children with symptoms of ARI

In Konobo, `28.1%` of children under five had experienced symptoms of ARI at some point in the two weeks preceding the 
survey. Out of these children, mothers of only `11.0%` sought out advice or treatment from a health facility.

### Children with fever

A massive `73.0%` of children had a fever at some point in the two weeks preceding the survey. Out of these children, 
mothers of `20.1%` sought out advice or treatment from a health facility.

### Children with diarrhea

`47.0%` of children experienced diarrhea (with or without blood in the stool) at some point in the two weeks preceding 
the survey, and `13.2%` experienced bloody diarrhea. Out of these children, mothers of `10.8%` sought out advice or 
treatment from a health facility.

### Vaccinations

In our sample, `23.7%` of women who had children living in the house with them were able to find at least one of their 
child's vaccine cards. Out of all children who had vaccine cards, only `11.0%` had received a full course of 
vaccinations, and not a single child had received a full course "on time" (i.e. according to the schedule set out by the 
WHO). `86.1%` of children had ever received the BCG vaccine, while only `63.1%` of children received the BCG vaccine on 
time.

Drop-off of the vaccination program was significant; while `63.6%` of children received the OPV0 vaccine on time, only 
`42.7%` received OPV1 on time, `19.2%` received OPV2 on time, and `14.7%` received OPV3 on time.
