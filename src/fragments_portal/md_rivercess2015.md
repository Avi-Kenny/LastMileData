Last Mile Survey: Rivercess Baseline (2015)
===========================================
*******************************************

Summary of findings - June 19, 2015

Purpose
-------

**ASSESS** the health status of the populations we serve

**GUIDE** the design and prioritization of health care programs

**EVALUATE** the impact of programs conducted by Last Mile Health

Methodology
-----------

**Questionnaire**: based primarily on the standard DHS questionnaire

**mHealth app design**: CommCare app that reflected paper questionnaire and improved data quality and data processing speed 

**Sampling & survey design**: two stage cluster model stratified by distance to clinic and phase 1 and phase 2 intervention districts

**Enumerator selection & training**: 10 Bassa speakers trained in questionnaire, mHealth, biases, probing, etc. 

**Implementation**: late March – April 2015 via 3 data collection teams & one roving supervisor via motorbike and foot in all six districts in Rivercess County

**Data management**: DCT -> central laptop -> CommCare HQ -> usable data files

**Statistical analysis**: use of Stata statistical software with compensation for survey design 

Sampling
--------

- `1,298` women living in `1,376` households were surveyed.
- All `six` health districts were covered.
- `76` different towns and villages were sampled.

Key Notes on Data
-----------------

- Biases: recall bias as predominant bias
- Survey instrument issues: some minor variables missing
- Data quality issues: misinterpretation of a few questions
- Early childhood mortality: pending further validation
- Perspective of enumerators: sometimes seen initially as Ebola workers/counselors
- Questionnaire and indicators slightly different from those of Konobo Baseline: to ensure comparability with DHS, stick to global standards, and collect programmatically relevant data 
- All estimates have a statistical margin of error:  Estimates’ precision are worsened in small subpopulations, so use care when making comparisons.  If you need estimates of statistical uncertainty, talk with an M&E team member - we can provide more detailed analyses.

Rivercess Stackup
-----------------

**Rivercess(2015) vs. DHS Rural (2013)**

![](../images/dataPortal/LMSRCphotos/RC31.1_V1.jpg)

- PNC = maternal post-natal care 
- Received formal care for diarrhea: among children under 5 who had diarrhea in the last 2 weeks, % who received care from a clinic or gCHV
- Received formal care for ARI: among children under 5 who had acute respiratory infection (ARI) in the last 2 weeks, % who received care from a clinic or gCHV
- Fully vaccinated: among children 12-23 months, % who have already received the basic vaccinations (BCG, Penta 1-3, OPV (oral Polio vaccine) 0-3, and measles)

**Rivercess Remove (2015) vs. Konobo (2012)**

Wrap Up
-------

**Next Steps**

- Further analysis: Further analysis will be conducted jointly with the CHT M&E department and presented jointly
- Full report: September 2015
- Results on Last Mile Data Portal: September 2015
- Further analyses: Complex analysis will be conducted over the coming months on a variety of topics. Suggestions for analysis topics are welcome.
- Gboe-Ploe & Konobo LMS: results in early October
- Early childhood mortality validation: September, following Health Survey analysis
- Follow-up survey: April – May, 2016

**Future Considerations**

- mHealth app switch: moved to ODK which is better for the user and cleaner data management
- Questionnaire improvements: more indicators and comparisons
- Improved training: fewer misinterpretation issues & better data quality
- Impact evaluations: possible after follow-up survey but complicated
